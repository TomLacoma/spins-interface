# spins-interface
Software for the SPINS project (interactive NMR spectrometer prototype)
See following link for the prototyping part of the project : https://wiki.fablab.sorbonne-universite.fr/BookStack/books/smart-prototype-of-an-interactive-nmr-spectrometer-spins

# Installation 
Make sure you have your favourite flavour of Python installed and up to date (it's been tested with version 3.14.2 but should work with most recent version) 
After downloading the code, you first have to install the dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file : simply navigate to the installation folder in your terminal and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```python -m pip install -r requirements``` and you should be done. 

# Usage
The spins_one-graph.py file is a wrapper to start the simulation, and contains all the parameters for now. Feel free to play with the code to see the result. 
The program can be run straight away with ```python spins_one-graph.py```.
